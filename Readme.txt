This is my 1st ever android application , It's a basic calculator that can do basic operations like + , - , * , / , ^(exponent) , and square root
It also follows the correct presidency and can also take expressions containing parenthesis () or decimal .
As of now , I am just getting familiar with the basics of android hence the application is yet not responsive , that will hopefully change in the near future
All suggestions are welcome.
